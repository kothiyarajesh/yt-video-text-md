# Intro to Data Science: Overview

hi everyone I'm Steve Brenton from the University of Washington and this is an overview in a new video series I'm calling an introduction to data science or intro to data science so data science is becoming a ubiquitous part of science engineering industry technology really it's a part of all of our lives and what this short video lecture sequence is going to do is just kind of give a brief introduction and overview to the various aspects of data science including kind of how to ask and answer questions with data data basing you know how do you manage data what's the nature of data what types of data do you have visualizing analyzing modeling data so things like machine learning building models from data neural networks and and lots more okay and so in this overview I just want to kind of tell you what you're gonna see and what some of my goals are for you and for for the sequence so I'll just start with some goals like I said one of my my primary goals is for this to be an overview I'm not gonna get into all of the nuts and bolts and nitty gritty about every type of machine learning or visualization in fact I'm going to keep things pretty high-level and pretty kind of general I'm going for a big picture so that you know where to look that's important I want you to know where to look for more so if you want to dig deeper into something I want to point you to the resources I want you to know what things are called kind of a terminology terminology so kind of how to just be basically literate in data science and machine learning what's the difference between a neural network and a different machine learning algorithm terminology is really important to know where to look and in this overview in addition to that I want us to be thinking about how to ask and answer questions how to ask the right questions how to ask and answer the right questions and that's very subjective so I'll put it in quotes the right questions okay part of that is understanding where your data has value and where it doesn't so understanding the value of data the value of data that's really important so a lot of people are just collecting more and more and more data and we have to ask is it the right data does it answer the questions that are actually important for me okay and I kind of want you to be excited so I'm very very excited about just the prospects of what you can do in data science in this kind of data-driven revolution so data science is pushing the boundaries of what we can do in lots of fields of science and engineering and technology and industry and so I want you to be excited about the opportunity and I also want you to understand what are the challenges because this is not a panacea or a silver bullet it's not like everything is now easy because of data science there are major challenges that go along with these opportunities so that's a lot of goals but really just giving you a high level overview being literate with what the different techniques in data science are and getting you excited about the opportunities and challenges in data science and what I want to really want to emphasize is in my opinion the data science is about you know it's not devoid of human experts it's a tool for human experts just like theory mathematics and experiments and simulations are tools for humans data science complements those disciplines those all generate tremendous amounts of data and data science is now a new field of science that is motivated by data intensive inquiry and study so so questions you know in the hands of an expert human are critical so what questions are we gonna ask and how can those questions be answered increasingly with data okay so how how do those questions get answered with data and then from my data how do I then refine the questions I'm asking maybe I ask new questions maybe I wasn't asking the right question in the first place and so there's this very interesting feedback cycle between asking questions and answering them with data and so that really is the heart of data science that's what we're gonna talk about this is going to include how to you know collect and clean and store your data what is the nature of your data what types of data might you see is it big data or small data is it you know sparse is the time series things like that we're gonna talk about how to visualize your data how to model and analyze your data with techniques in machine learning okay and so the way I'm gonna run this is you know each of those big categories there might be a five or 10 minute overview that kind of like this gives you the lay of the land and then there will be kind of deeper dives so for example in machine learning we'll talk about the principles of machine learning and then we'll start to dig into you know the the more nuts and bolts aspects different methods different types of data different categories of machine learning so I'm really excited to kind of take you through this intro to data science again this is not comprehensive this is not complete this field is changing very fast but I think this will give you a good overview and and kind of get you excited and help you figure out where to look for more all right thank you
